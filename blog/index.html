		<h3> November 11, 2018 </h3>
		Recently, the Washington Post published an  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2018/11/09/problem-solvers-tomorrows-workforce/?utm_term=.dfe47dd77e25"> an op-ed</a> 
		written by William and Mary's president, Katherine A. Rowe, and never before has an article resonated with me on so many levels. I am a current 
		graduate student and soon to be alumna of The College, hold bachelor's degrees in Art History and Psychology, and thus come from a background very 
		much grounded in the liberal arts and now as I continue my education and career within the field of data analytics.
