		<h3> TIME SERIES ANALYSIS </h3>
		For this project I worked in <strong>Python</strong> with data from the U.S. Census describing private and public sector spending on 
		construction in the United States from 2002 through 2013 with partial data for 2014. One major objective of this project
		was to use time series regression methods to analyze and extract meaningful statistics and characteristics surrounding 
		patterns of the two sectors using the SciPy library.  Second, matplotlib and its numerical mathematics extension numpy were 
		used to visualize and thus provide a way to remove some of the noise and better understand the trends and patterns 
		presented. The data was mined from <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/c30/historical_data.html"> this website</a> 
		which provides further information about collection methods and sources. <br>
