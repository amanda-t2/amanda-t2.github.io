		<h3> TIME SERIES ANALYSIS </h3>
	For this project I worked in <strong>Python</strong> with data from the U.S. Census describing private and public sector spending on 
	construction in the United States from 2002 through 2013 with partial data for 2014. One major objective of this project
	was to use time series regression methods to analyze and extract meaningful statistics and characteristics surrounding 
	patterns of the two sectors using the SciPy library.  Second, matplotlib and its numerical mathematics extension numpy were 
	used to visualize and thus provide a way to remove some of the noise and better understand the trends and patterns 
	presented. The data was mined from <a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/c30/historical_data.html"> this website</a> 
	and which also provides further information about collection methods and sources. <br>

		<h3> DAILY CODING PROBLEMS </h3>
	Many thanks to <a href="https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/">dailycodingproblem.com</a> for the wonderful and very helpful daily 
	sample programming questions. Below are a few of the ways that I went about answering some of the questions, and I aim to consistently update this file.<br>
